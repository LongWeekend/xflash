Chinese Flash is more than just a flash card app; it's a tool to help you learn Chinese tone pronounciation, and to be able to differentiate tones.
</p>
<p>
<strong>We strongly recommend using a WiFi connection.</strong>
</p>
<h3>Here's how it works</h3>
<p>
After installation: Tap the &quot;Audio&quot; icon on each study card.  You'll hear a pronounciation of the pinyin tones on that card, in order.
Also, you can listen to music while studying -- your music will simply duck out while the tones are playing.  Cool, right?
</p>
<p>
Each tone has been recorded by a native speaker; the tones are resources of Lingomi (http://lingomi.com/), used with permission under license.
</p>
<h3>Why do I have to download something?</h3>
<p>
We separated the components (dictionary search, audio, etc.) into downloadable updates to make it easier to deliver new data as it changes.
</p>
<h3><em>Enjoy the Awesome Pinyin Audio!</em></h3>
