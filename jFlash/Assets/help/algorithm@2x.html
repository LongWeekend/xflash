    Japanese Flash uses some very smart statistics to work out which cards
    you should study next. Cards you know well appear less often, cards you
    are having trouble with are shown more often. This approach is similar to 
    the <strong>Leitner System</strong> and other spaced repetition systems (SRS)</strong>.

    When you study large sets, a pool of cards to study is selected. New cards are added as you learn the cards in the pool.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Unique to Japanese Flash</strong>, you can change the difficulty of practice under <strong>Settings</strong>. 
    By changing the number of cards in the "studying pool", or the frequency new cards appear, studying gets easier or harder.
    You can also choose to exclude learned words from study using the "Hide Learned Cards" switch.

    If this sounds confusing, don't worry! There are presets for <em><strong>easy, medium &amp; hard</strong></em>
    so you don't have to worry about the math (worry about Japanese *grin*).
