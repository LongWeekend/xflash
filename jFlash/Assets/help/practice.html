  <p>In <strong>Practice Mode</strong>, card meanings are hidden until you tap the card.
  Once the meaning is revealed, you can indicate whether you got it <strong>right</strong> or <strong>wrong</strong>. 
  If you know the word already, or simply don't like it, you can press <strong>bury it</strong> - the card will immediately become <strong>Learned</strong>.
  </p>
  <p>Using the <strong>Actions</strong> button, you can add the card to other sets (including your starred words), tweet the word, or report a correction.</p>

  <p>
  The first time you get a card right, it moves from <strong>Studying</strong> to <strong>Right 1x</strong>.
  Each time you get it right, it will be promoted to a higher level.
  </p>

  <p>
    Get it right five times and it will be marked as <strong>Learned</strong>. The progress pop-up
    shows detailed results for the current set. Tap the progress bar to display it.
  </p>
    <p>Note that cards that are <strong>Learned</strong> will still appear - just much less often. Japanese Flash is making sure you haven't forgetten them!</p>
