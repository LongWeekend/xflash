    We think Japanese Flash is the best way to study Japanese vocabulary. We also know there are other
    great apps out there for reading Japanese, including

    Rikai Browser</a>, our excellent web
    browser with a built in Japanese to English dictionary. When using those apps, you often want to remember a new
    word you come across while reading. What if you could combine both? Japanese Flash allows other apps
    to integrate dictionary search into their own apps.

    How does it work? Simply follow a link jflash://JAPANESE_WORD to open jFlash from another app and launch
    a search for the word. For example, the link jflash://日本語 will launch jflash and search for 日本語. This
    feature will be built into Rikai Browser; ask your other favorite apps to include this functionality as
    well and let's build the perfect environment for learning, reviewing and retaining Japanese!
