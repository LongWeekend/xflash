  Tap on the <strong>Study Sets</strong> tab and press <strong>+</strong> to add a set. You can add words to the set using
  the <strong>Search</strong>. You can also add cards to a set whilst in 
  practice mode using the <strong>Add To Set</strong> button.

    We believe an iPhone is a great way to practice, but not great for creating flash cards.
    For now this functionality is limited. However we are thinking of ways to solve this.
