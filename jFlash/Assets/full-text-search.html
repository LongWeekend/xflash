  <h2>Awesomely Fast Dictionary 1.1 (12MB)</h2>
<p>
Japanese Flash is more than just a flash card program.  When you download &amp; install this plugin, it's also blazingly fast dictionary that can search 150,000 entries in less than a second.
</p>
<p>
First, press "Start" below to begin the download &amp; installation (it's free of course!). Make sure you have a good network connection (preferably WiFi).
</p>
<p>
Here's how it works after installation: tap the &quot;Search&quot; icon at the bottom of the screen from the main screen (you probably already figured that out - that's how you got here!).
Type a word in Japanese (kanji, romaji, or hiragana is OK!) or English, press &quot;Search&quot;, and look at the results.  If you install
</p>
<p>
Once you've found a particular result that is interesting, or you want to remember, tap the word to proceed to add it to a study set.  One common use of this feature is to create a study set 
for new words that you encounter &quot;in the wild&quot;.  Then, every time you search a new word in the dictionary, you can immediately add it to that study set for later review.
</p>
<p>
Also, you may want to know why we're asking you to download this plugin separately from the application itself. That's a great question. And, since you are Awesome (you purchased Japanese Flash after all!), we'll share Our Evil Master Plan.
</p>
<p>
We separated the components (dictionary search, example sentences, et cetera) into plugins to make it easier to update the data as it changes. We all know language changes - so your iPhone study application needs to change with it. So, in the future, if we receive reports of errors in the dictionary, we will be able to roll out changes to everyone. Cool, right?
</p>
<p>
Enjoy our Awesomely Fast dictionary!
