  <h2>Update Dictionary (30MB)</h2>
  <p>Thanks for Awesomely upgrading to Japanese Flash 1.1!  Now that you have 1.1, you'll need to update your dictionary.</p>
  <p>
  <strong class="red">Please download &amp; install the latest dictionary by pressing &quot;Start&quot; below.</strong>
  </p>
  <p>You'll need a network connection during the download phase, and the entire update should take between 3-5 minutes (we recommend you use WiFi if your carrier charges you for bandwidth usage on 3G).
  </p>
  <p>
  If now is not a convenient time, tap <em>Cancel</em>, and go to the <em>Settings</em> tab when you're ready.
  </p>
  <p>
  You may want to know why you're downloading this update separately. That's a great question. Since you are Awesome (you purchased Japanese Flash after all!), we'll share <em>Our Evil Master Plan</em>.
  </p>
  <p>
  We separated the dictionary, example sentences, and other components into &quot;plug-ins&quot; to make it easier to update the data as it changes.
  </p>
  <p>
  For example, if someone finds an error in the dictionary, wouldn't it be great if it was fixed automatically? We are not there yet, but this release is a step in that direction.
  </p>
  <p>
  So, here are the full details of the new features in Japanese Flash 1.1:
  <ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Inline Example Sentences</strong>
    <p>
    While you are studying, swipe the card to see example sentences!  You'll need to download the example sentences plug-in.  Tap <em>Settings</em>, open the <em>Plugins</em>; section, and tap to download &amp; install the example sentences after this update.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Custom Study Settings</strong>
    <p>
    Some users told us that cards they know are shown too frequently.  Other users told us that somewhat-known cards don't appear often enough. 
    We make everyone happy by giving you control: tap &quot;Settings&quot; to adjust how Japanese Flash quizzes.  You can set it to <em>Easy</em>, <em>Medium</em>, <em>Hard</em>, or choose your own custom settings.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Improved Dictionary Quality &amp; Feedback Tool</strong>
    <p>
    We've improved the quality of the dictionary (what you're downloading right now!).  We've removed a few duplicate cards and fixed a few &quot;word sense&quot; errors.
    Best of all, we've turned the editorial hand over to you, the user.  The <em>Add To Set</em> button on the Practice screen is now titled <em>Action</em>, and it
    does two things:
    </p>
    <p>
    <img src="jflash-1.1-features-actionsheet.png" alt="Action Menu" />
    </p>
    <p>
    <strong>Help Us Fix This Card</strong>: Find something wrong?  Tell us - we'll incorporate the changes and push it back out to all Japanese Flash users.
    </p>
    <p>
    <strong>Add To Card Set</strong>: Allows you to add or remove the current card to and from different study sets (same behavior as 1.0).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Smaller Download Size</strong>
    <p>
    By creating a plug-in structure, the base of Japanese Flash is now small enough to download &quot;over the air&quot; on a 3G network.  Now, anyone can download 
    Japanese Flash anywhere, anytime!  Help us spread the word - the more people using JFlash, the stronger the dictionary will become!
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Follow Us</strong>
    <p>
    Okay, so it's not really a feature - but if you want to take a break from studying, check out the <em>Follow Us</em> section on the <em>Settings</em> tab.  You can 
    follow us on Twitter, or view Japanese Flash on Facebook.  We update frequently with what we're doing - if you want to know what'll make it into the next version!
