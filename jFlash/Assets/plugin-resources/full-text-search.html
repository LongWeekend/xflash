Japanese Flash is more than just a flash card program.  When you download &amp; install this update, it's also blazingly fast dictionary that can search 150,000 entries in less than a second.
</p>
<p><strong>Press &quot;Start Download&quot; to begin updating.</strong></p>
<p>You'll need a network connection for the download. <strong>We strongly recommend using a WiFi connection.</strong>
You can get the update via your mobile network (3G), however it takes a while due to download speed limits.
</p>
<h3>Here's how it works</h3>
<p>
After installation: tap the &quot;Search&quot; icon at the bottom of the screen from the main screen (you probably already figured that out - that's how you got here!).
Type a word in Japanese (kanji, romaji, or hiragana is OK!) or English, press &quot;Search&quot;, and look at the results.
</p>
<p>
Once you've found a particular result that is interesting, or you want to remember, tap the word to proceed to add it to a study set.  One common use of this feature is to create a study set for new words that you encounter &quot;in the wild&quot;.  Then, every time you search a new word in the dictionary, you can immediately add it to that study set for later review.
</p>
<h3>Why do I have to download something?</h3>
<p>
We separated the components (dictionary search, example sentences, etc) into downloadable updates to make it easier to deliver new data as it changes.</p>
<p>
We all know language changes - so your iPhone study application needs to change with it. So if we receive reports of errors in the dictionary, we will be able to roll out changes to everyone automatically, without re-installing the application. Cool, right?
</p>
<p>
That platform isn't quite ready yet - but we are working on it - and this change was a key step along the way.
</p>
